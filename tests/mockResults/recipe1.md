# Chicken, sausage & mushroom stew

## Method

1. Put the rice into a pan with 300ml of boiling water or and a small pinch of sea salt, cover and cook on a medium-high heat for 12 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed.

2. Squeeze the sausage-meat out of the skin, breaking it into little balls, then place in a frying pan on a medium-high heat and fry for 3 minutes.

3. Tear in the mushrooms, peel, very finely slice and add the onion, strip in the thyme, add Â½ a tablespoon of olive oil and fry for 5 minutes, or until softened and lightly golden, stirring regularly.

4. Stir in the mustard, cream and 150ml of water or reserved stock, followed by the chicken and spinach. Reduce to a simmer for 5 minutes, then season the stew to perfection with salt and black pepper.

Serve with the rice and a pinch of cayenne pepper, to taste.
